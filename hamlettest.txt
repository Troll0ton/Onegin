My father's spirit- in arms? All is not well.
I doubt some foul play. Would the night were come!
Till then sit still, my soul. Foul deeds will rise,
Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.
Exit.


Scene III.
Elsinore. A room in the house of Polonius.
Enter Laertes and Ophelia.

Laer. My necessaries are embark'd. Farewell.
And, sister, as the winds give benefit

And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
But let me hear from you.
